								<h4><b><p style="color:red;">  About Project Description  </p></b></h4>
								<p class="about-paddingB">Every university maintains placements and recruit department which consults/visits various companies to known about job vacancies and takes the permission to conduct interviews for their students to provide jobs.  Students in university goes to placements department and register their information such as qualification, address,  name,  email, mobile etc. and are informed through emails or on phone about the placements when conducted.  All this process is time taking and work burden on the placements department, companies and students.  
We develop a website using PHP and MySql that runs in the cloud to the university to integrate placements department, companies and students so that all the above activities can be performed easily and faster.  In the website companies registers and posts all job vacancies and eligibility criteria.  Students also register in the website and post their information like qualifications, skills on technologies, address, experience etc.  Students can view all the job vacancies posted by companies and apply for jobs to companies based on their qualification and eligibility.  This website contain simple chat bot in the student portal where they can search for jobs faster by asking some questions.  Student gets notifications in the website whether they got selected for the interview or not and also gets interview date and time etc.  Companies can short list the students for the interview by conducting a simple online exam.  After conducting interview companies post the results in the website so that students can view in their logins.  Companies can view all studentsâ€™ information and can short list the students for interview whenever they require employees.
